# Gradient Background Generator:
View live website: https://victorhugo183.github.io/background-generator/<br>
One of my first web projects, a website where you can pick colours for a gradient background and view the CSS code for it.

### Goal:
To learn to manipulate the DOM with Javascript

### Features:
<ul>
  <li>
    View gradient background and its code by selecting two colours
  </li>
  <li>
    Toggle to display RGB or HEX values
  </li>
  <li>
    Save and load background functionality, saving to localStorage could be used to improve this.
  </li>
  <li>
    generate random background - at the time of writing this code I did not know it was possible to convert a number to hexadecimal by simply using ParseInt(value, 16), but I left in my <em>interesting</em> solution to this problem
  </li>
</ul>
